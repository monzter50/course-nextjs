## Course NextJs

Little project for test NextJs

## Manual Setup

Install it in your project:

`npm install --save next react react-dom`

and add a script to your package.json like this:

`{ "scripts": { "dev": "next", "build": "next build", "start": "next start" } }`

After that, the file-system is the main API. Every .js file becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered.

## TODO:

- Use Api [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Render list post
- User nextlinks
